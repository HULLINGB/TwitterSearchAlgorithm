# TwitterSearchAlgorithm
Twitter search algorithm for MySQL database


SearchAlgorithmForTwitter.java uses a HashMap to store a sorted set of charsInARow.
Hashmaps map.get() method goes to the last declared entry called and returns
that value and we print that value. When topResult[] array is assigned values
it may assigned the same username to multiple positions, which we then print.
SearchAlgorithmForTwitter2.java seeks to allow us to use an AssertThat to access
different values of HashMap with our map.get() method to return different values of
HashMap refernced by array3 positions that have the same value.
